# LightMeter

This Android app is intended to help interior designers to measure the luminance of rooms, in order to analyse which areas need more light or to know if the light is adequate to tasks executed in these rooms.
It came to light in one of my mobile development specialization classes when the teacher asked us to create an app in something like 40 minutes, using some of the Android device sensors.
My group choose to use the device's light sensor and this is the result.

## How it works

It's very simple, just open the app an it gets the value registered by the light sensor and show the number in Luxes (or Lx) and give a tip on which kind of ambient the light condition is better for. The background image fades according to light level.
